# Tracks

- Internet of Things [4 goals]
- Machine Learning [3 goals]
- Large Language Models [1 goal]

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFA600" -->

# Rules

- Your team needs to complete at least 1 goal to win a **Lego** set.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFA600" -->

# Resources

send `fvalle@elemento.cloud` a **ssh *public* key** and you will have access to a **V100 GPU**

---

# Track 1

Deploy a VM **using Elemento technology** and your **voice**.

----

## Goal(s) of the track

Develop a tool able to create and destroy VMs using users' voice. Deliver a code able to call our REST API as written in the specifications. The code should be triggered by a voice assistant and managed through Elemento daemons.

You can choose one of the following assistants:

- Google
- Alexa
- Cortana
- Siri

----

## hint

Look at [homebridge](https://homebridge.io) and its plugins

---

# Track 2

Train some ML models to help users deal with the configuration of **Elemento virtual machines**.

----

## Goal(s) of the track

- train a model to create new **MesOS translators**
- train a model to create [custom vm configurations](https://github.com/Elemento-Modular-Cloud/electros)
- train a model to infer configurations from Software specifics found on the internet

----

### Example of Elemento config file


```json
{
    "slots": 16,
    "overprovision": 4,
    "allowSMT": false,
    "archs": ["X86_64"],
    "flags": ["sse2"],
    "ramsize": 30048,
    "reqECC": false,
    "misc": {"os_family": "windows", "os_flavour": "windows"},
    "pci": [
        {
            "vendor": "10de",
            "model": "2489",
            "quantity": 2
        },
        {
            "vendor": "10de",
            "model": "228b",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    ]
}
```


----

### MesOS translator
* **input**: Elemento REST API specification and CSP API specification

* **output**: Code to translate one into the other


----

### Create custom VM configuration

* **input**: verbose specification of requirements

* **output**: Elemento-like spec file

----

### Create VM configuration from software name

* **input**: name of software (i.e. Autocad, Ansys, Crysis)

* **output**: Elemento-like spec file

----

## Hints

*scraping* is your friend

---

# Track 3

Train any Large Language Model to interact with Elemento API.
*GPT can you create a VM for me?*

----

## Rules

train a llm to create and manage VMs using elemento
